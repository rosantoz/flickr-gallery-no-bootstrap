Flickr Image Search
=======================

A simple implementation of Flickr's API in PHP.

The user enters a keyword, which is then used to search Flickr.

The search results are paginated and displayed as five results per page,
and the user is able to navigate to other pages. Each image is displayed as a thumbnail;
clicking on the thumbnail opens the original image on a new window.
